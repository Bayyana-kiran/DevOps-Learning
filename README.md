# DevOps-Assignment
I have actively explored and gained hands-on experience with key DevOps tools and practices. I started by diving into **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, where I familiarized myself with core services like EC2, S3, and IAM, and experimented with deploying applications in the cloud. Moving on to **Docker**, I learned how to containerize applications, build images, run containers, and push them to Docker Hub, which significantly improved my understanding of environment consistency and portability. I then progressed to **Kubernetes**, exploring its architecture, core components (Pods, Services, Deployments), and used `kubectl` to manage applications in a local Minikube cluster. Finally, I worked with **CI/CD pipelines**, understanding the continuous integration and delivery process, and practiced setting up automated workflows using tools like GitHub Actions and AWS CodePipeline. This journey has strengthened my DevOps skill set and prepared me to build, ship, and manage modern cloud-native applications more efficiently.
